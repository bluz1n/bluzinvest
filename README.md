# bluzinvest
bluzinvest was made for my final project on the Framework class. The main goal on this was to make a App that the user could see and add transactions, to follow the spendings.

Also, this was made possible with the Ignite camp, from Rocketseat.

I used HTML, ReactJS, Typescript (and TSX) along with other services, like Axios and MirageJS

Instructions:

First, install the dependencies by using 'yarn', then, to start the web server use 'yarn start'
